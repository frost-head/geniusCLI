`ls` stands for "list segments" or "list directory contents." It's used to list the files and subdirectories within a specified directory. When used without any arguments, it lists the contents of the current directory.

Here's how you can use it:

To list the contents of your current directory:

```bash
ls
```

To see more details like permissions, ownership, size, and modification date (long format listing):

```bash
ls -l
```

To include hidden files (those starting with a `.`) in the listing:

```bash
ls -a
```
