Hey there! I'm CLI Genius, happy to help you out.

You've got a Python script `API/gemini.api.py` and want to run it. Looking at your past commands, it seems you've almost got it, just a tiny typo!

To run your Python program, you should use the `python` command followed by the script's path.

**Here's how to run it:**

1.  **Correct the Command:** The command you need is `python API/gemini.api.py`.
    *   You previously used `pytho` or `pyth`, which are typos. The correct command is `python`.
    *   `sudo` is generally not needed for running your own scripts unless they require elevated system permissions (which your API script likely doesn't).

2.  **Install Missing Libraries:** Your script imports `google.generativeai`. While you installed `python-dotenv` earlier, you'll also need the Google Generative AI library.
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai
    ```

**Step-by-step:**

1.  **Install the necessary library:**
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai
    ```
    (You already have `python-dotenv` installed from your history, which is good!)

2.  **Run your program:**
    ```bash
    python API/gemini.api.py
    ```

**Explanation:**

*   `python`: This invokes the Python interpreter installed on your system.
*   `API/gemini.api.py`: This is the path to your Python script that the interpreter will execute.

If you don't have Python installed, you'd typically download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or install it via your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install python3` on Debian/Ubuntu, `brew install python` on macOS). You can check if it's installed by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version`
